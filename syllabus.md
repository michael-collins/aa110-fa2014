##Description [Bulletin Undergraduate](http://bulletins.psu.edu/undergrad/courses/A/A&A/110)
This course is the first of a series of required courses for the Interdisciplinary Digital Studio (IDS) degree. Students in A&A 110 will gain an interdisciplinary and collaborative foundation through the studio-based exploration of digital media arts and design processes. This course will foster interdisciplinary awareness and diverse perspectives and provide students with a common language with which they can communicate and collaborate with other students in the arts and design disciplines. The course will integrate a variety of methodologies and approaches rather than discipline-specific subject matter and be especially significant to such areas as learning to think critically, learning to engage in critical dialogue, and development of research skills. It will provide an introduction to, and discussion of, the processes of historical thinking and methodology as these pertain to the work and experience of historical and living digital media artists and designers.

Through the completion of studio-based projects encompassing a wide range of digital media, including image production and manipulation, basic interactivity/hypermedia, interface design, 3D modeling, animation, digital fabrication, audio, and video, students will create a portfolio of work that will enable them to make informed and guided choices as to the further focusing of their studies in the digital arts and design. Students will be introduced to various collaborative situations and approaches to be utilized as necessary based on the needs of the project. In the following year, students will build upon the explorations of this course through more focused and rigorous studio work in A&A 210 as well as other relevant courses to the degree.

## Course Objectives
**Upon completing the course each student will have:**
- Learned the basics of 3D Animation, Modeling, and production and post­production.
- Completed technical/conceptual projects (assignments) as set out by the instructor, accompanied by an artist statement.
- Assessed projects in relation to the stated objectives of the assignment.
- Developed a language suitable for descriptive and critical understandings of their assignments and broader themes related to interdisciplinarity digital design.
- Participated actively in all group work and ­discussions.

## Course Requirements
Each class will meet in 401 Paterson. Attendance is mandatory; as this time will be used for
critiques, reading discussions, slide presentations, video screenings and the dissemination of
general information. These sessions will at all times emphasize critical analysis and in­class
discussion. In terms of studio production, whole class meetings may review work­in­progress;
assess ongoing technical concerns; assist with immediate needs of a project concept and
execution all the while continuing to develop a language appropriate for evaluation and critique.
While there will be a limited amount of in­class time to experiment and complete work, you will
be required to spend many hours working outside of class­time.

## Course Prerequisites
Prerequisite: Prerequisite or concurrent: A&A 101, A&A 102S
Concurrent: or A&A 103, A&A 104
